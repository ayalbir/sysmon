**What I did:**  
- Created the initial project structure and set up a GitHub repository.
- Scanned through the instructions and planned what to learn.
- Started researching the `psutil` library to understand its capabilities for system monitoring.

**Directions considered:**  
- Reading through the `psutil` documentation to understand how to fetch CPU and memory usage.

**Bugs encountered:**  
- None so far.

**Resources used:**  
- ChatGPT with the prompt: "what's psutil and how do I use it in python, for what and such".
- used the [psutil documentation](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to understand how to fetch CPU and memory usage.
